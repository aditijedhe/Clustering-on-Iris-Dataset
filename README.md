# Clustering-on-Iris-Dataset

### Objectives:
1. Illustrate KMeans  Clustering
2. Use Elbow Method as a way to find optimum number of clusters
3. Illustrate Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering on Iris Dataset, considering only two features - Sepal Length and Petal Width.

### Problem Statement:
Clustering method to classified species of Iris dataset.

### Approach :
Most of the part of the questions in this lab needed data visualization and data modelling, so use seaborn and matplotlib, sklearn library of python to work out the given questions. And also use scipy for identifying outliers.
